title: You're up and running!

My name is<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> Giselle Rivas</span>. I am a junior in High School and a freshman in college. I know what you are thinking… many people ask me the same question “how are you in high school but taking college classes”? and my reply to them remains the same. 3 years ago we got an opportunity to take college classes but, we were still taking high school classes at the same time. The benefit of this program is great because we would be able to graduate with our associate degree. Besides school I dedicate my time to soccer. This sport has not only helped me on gaining better skills, but its helped me throughout bad situations in my life. What I mean by that is that I really never had an easy life. everything I’ve been through, I handled it by myself so I would choose soccer to distract and distant myself from everything and everyone. I’m happy that I would always make that decision to distract myself because now I am playing varsity soccer at my high school and I am looking forward to apply for scholar ships or maybe even scouts and go look and see how passionate I am about for the sport .

<h1><em><strong>What I'm I Doing Here?</strong></em></h1>
Most people ask "Giselle What are you doing here" or " How and why are you doing this"? i always get excited when they ask me because i have so much to say. I have thousands of reasons why i am here but 2 are only important to me. The first reason why i am here its because i want to make my parents proud. As of you all know our parents back in the day never had these types of opportunities.Obviously they want the best of us, and go beyond . you know that saying parents say "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">i want you to have what i didn't" or "i want you to be better than me". That phrase always melts my heart.</span>  The reason why its because i know my parents had it hard . All i want it's to make them proud and finish strong;for i can give them what they never had. Making them proud wouldn't pay everything they had sacrificed for me;but one day i would give them the world . In addition the second reason why i am here is to set an example to my little sisters. Right now they are to young to understand. Little do they know what i am doing today will help them out when they are older. I want my sisters to be better than me . I want them to say one day that "Giselle made this happen" or "she is a perfect example as an older sister". i know i am not the best but i'll make anything count as longest they are okay.

<h1><em><strong>Will You Take This Experience?</strong></em></h1>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">This college experience has helped me so much. I never thought a 14,15,16,17 year old can start college. Everyday that passes you learn many new things. i can admit that they were some days that i felt like dropping out because i felt like i wasn't smart enough. Things were just going by so fast that in a blink of an eye i wasn't passing. Let me put it like this if you do something in life then it's a purpose . As my father always told me "finish what you started" those words always comes across my mind when i am feeling powerless. Not only has this taught me strength but its gained me some dignity. ill tell you from experience that it is a lot to take in as a young teenager ; If you actually take some time you start to realize that you have come a long way to give up. All that work was for nothing? all the stressing? all the tears? all the ups and downs? for what? like i said everything has a purpose . Do what you have to do in order to succeed in life. This is now . Later you are going to laugh at all the pain you have put your self through. Once you keep going everything that crosses your way you will be able to know how to suck it up and keep on going. .</p>

<h1><em><strong>When Will i Be Done ?</strong></em></h1>
Truthfully i feel like i will never be done. or maybe even anybody. How are you even sure when you are done? i don't really think no one knows the answer to that question . No matter how much you work or try. There is no way anybody can be done until they are happy with themselves ;and the choices they have made up to that point. Everyone goes through different situations in life and everyone finishing point will obviously be different from mine. Life has a different plan for you everyday; but if i had no choice... in my opinion if i will be done it has to be when, i am settled with a house ,a job that i love doing and maintaining a healthy life style. Which is hard now and days because everything is so expensive and fast going . I wont stop until i know i am stable enough. i wont stop until i give the people that sacrificed for me and give them something in return ; and i wont stop until i know there is nothing left for me to worry about . i can't say it would be tomorrow because it wont. This is a long term goal and i am hoping to make it.
<h1><em><strong>Why Should We Care?</strong></em></h1>
Why shouldn't we care? anything we do in today's society means something . The life you live its yours . You get to control how you live .you only get one life and no body cares about it like you do .  Blessings comes in ways you least expect them to come . if you get the love and happiness you desire nothing else really matters if life just feels right in that moment.<del> Knowing your worth is the most important thing.</del>
